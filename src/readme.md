Credits and Acknowledgements
=======================
I would like to acknowledge Dr. Malgorzata Chrzanowska-Jeske
for providing the steps to completing the project. This was
an assignment as part of Professor Jeske ECE428 VLSI Computer
Aided Design class Fall 2013.

General Information
===================
This project demonstrates the Kernighanâ€“Lin algorithm to partition
a set of vertices. It was programmed in C++ language for a Linux 
environment. 

File Manifest
=============
The files included in project build are:

1.	project.cpp
2.	KLpartition.h
3.	KLpartition.cpp
4.	kl.txt
5.	kl2.txt
6.	kl3.txt
7.	kl4.txt
8.	kl5.txt
4.	makefile
5.	project

Compiling
=========
Pre-compiled binaries are available for Ubuntu Linux 10.04 and newer.  
Compiling this software is handled by a makefile. Copy all the files
provided into a build directory then run the makefile. You can do 
this by doing the following: 

$ mkdir build
$ cp project /build
$ cp project.cpp /build
$ cp KLpartition.h /build
$ cp KLpartition.cpp /build
$ cp kl.txt /build
$ cp kl2.txt /build
$ cp kl3.txt /build
$ cp kl4.txt /build
$ cp kl5.txt /build
$ cp makefile /build
$ cp readme.md /build
$ cd build
$ make

Running 
============
You can run the program one of two ways. You can provide the file 
name for the .txt file containing information on the vertices or 
you can use the default "kl.txt" file. Example:

$./project filename.txt

or the default file "kl.txt":

$./project
